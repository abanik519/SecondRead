          In this story "The Honeyguide's Revenge," Gingele gets honeycomb out of a hive.&nbsp;He uses a smoking stick to calm the bees first.&nbsp;How does the smoking stick work? 
          &nbsp;When there is smoke the bees cannot detect alarm signals that would normally cause them to attack an intruder.&nbsp;Smoke also makes them think there is a forest fire so 
          they eat a lot of honey before leaving their hive to look for a new home.&nbsp;It is hard for them to sting when they are full of honey.
